# Aegis Framework Integration

## Overview

We use the [Aegis Framework](mdc:https:/buildsomething.ai/aegis) for AI-powered project planning and execution.

## Setup Requirements

For the AI assistant in Cursor to use Aegis commands:

1. **Copy Aegis to your project**
   - Add the Aegis framework to `.context` folder in your project root
   - This folder contains all framework files and instructions

2. **Configure Cursor with COMMANDS.json**
   - Copy the contents of `.context/COMMANDS.json`
   - Add it to Cursor's rules section (Settings â†’ Rules)
   - This uses a smaller context window, making AI interactions more efficient

## Usage

Once configured, the AI can execute Aegis commands through natural language. Common commands include:
- `/aegis plan` - Project planning
- `/aegis start` - Start development session
- `/aegis save` - Save progress
- `/aegis task` - Task management
- `/aegis status` - Check status

## Documentation

All Aegis documentation is maintained in the `.context` folder:
- `.context/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete framework documentation
- `.context/COMMANDS.json` - Command definitions
- `.context/README.md` - Aegis overview

## Integration Notes

- Reference task IDs in git commits (e.g., "Related: TASK-001")
- Follow the workflows defined in the `.context` documentation
