# Code Organization Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file should do one thing well
2. **Encapsulation**: Hide implementation details behind clear interfaces
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Consistency**: Follow the same patterns throughout the codebase
5. **Discoverability**: Code should be easy to find and understand
